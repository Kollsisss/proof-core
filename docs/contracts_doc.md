# Smart Contracts in Proof Blockchain

## Introduction

**Smart contracts are self-executing agreements with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. In Proof Blockchain, we've simplified this concept to make it accessible to everyone, regardless of their technical background. This document will guide you through creating, managing, and understanding smart contracts on our platform.**

## Creating a Smart Contract

### Step 1: Choose a Template

1. Log in to your Proof Wallet.
2. Navigate to "Create New Contract".
3. Browse our library of pre-made templates, including:
   - Sale and Purchase Agreements
   - Rental Contracts
   - Service Agreements
   - Employment Contracts
   - And many more...

### Step 2: Fill in the Details

1. Select your chosen template.
2. Fill in the required fields. These typically include:
   - Parties involved (names and Proof addresses)
   - Key terms of the agreement (e.g., price, duration, specific conditions)
   - Date of execution

### Step 3: Review and Customize

1. Review the auto-generated contract.
2. Use our intuitive editor to make any necessary changes or additions.
3. Add conditional clauses if needed (e.g., "If X happens, then Y will occur").

### Step 4: Sign and Deploy

1. Click "Sign and Deploy".
2. Confirm the transaction in your Proof Wallet.
3. Wait for confirmation (usually within 1-2 minutes).

## Managing Your Smart Contract

### Viewing Contract Details

1. Go to "My Contracts" in your Proof Wallet.
2. Select the contract you wish to view.
3. You'll see:
   - Contract status (Active, Executed, or Cancelled)
   - Full contract terms
   - Transaction history

### Executing Contract Terms

Many contract terms will execute automatically when conditions are met. For manual execution:

1. Go to the specific contract.
2. Click "Execute Term".
3. Follow the prompts to complete the action.

### Cancelling a Contract

Remember, you have a 10-minute window to unilaterally cancel a contract after creation.

1. Go to the contract within 10 minutes of its creation.
2. Click "Cancel Contract".
3. Confirm the cancellation in your wallet.

After 10 minutes, cancellation requires agreement from all parties or must follow the terms specified in the contract.

## Advanced Features

### Custom Clause Builder

For users comfortable with more complex agreements:

1. In the contract editor, click "Add Custom Clause".
2. Use our visual programming interface to create custom logic.
3. Test your clause with our simulator before adding it to the contract.

### Multi-Party Contracts

1. When creating a contract, click "Add Party" to include more than two parties.
2. Specify the role and requirements for each party.

### Contract Inheritance

For creating a new contract based on an existing one:

1. In "My Contracts", select a contract and click "Create Similar".
2. The new contract will inherit terms from the original, which you can then modify.

## Security and Privacy

- All contracts are publicly verifiable on the Proof blockchain.
- Personal details can be encrypted; only the terms and execution of the contract are public.
- Use our built-in identity verification system for added security in high-stakes contracts.

## Dispute Resolution

While Proof aims to minimize disputes through clear, executable terms:

1. Built-in arbitration options are available in many contract templates.
2. Users can specify their preferred method of dispute resolution when creating a contract.

## Integrating with Real-World Execution

- For contracts requiring real-world execution (e.g., property transfers), we partner with licensed professionals in various jurisdictions.
- API integrations allow for automatic updates from trusted external sources (e.g., price feeds for financial contracts).

## For Developers

- Explore our API documentation to build applications that interact with Proof smart contracts.
- Use AIPL (AI Prompt Language) to create complex smart contract templates without traditional coding.

## Best Practices

1. Always thoroughly review your contract before signing.
2. Use clear, specific language in custom clauses.
3. Ensure all parties understand the terms, especially automated execution clauses.
4. Regularly check your active contracts for any required actions or updates.

Remember, while Proof smart contracts simplify legal agreements, they can have real-world implications. For high-value or complex agreements, consider consulting with a legal professional.
