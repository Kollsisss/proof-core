# Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as participants and supporters commit to making involvement in our project and community free from harassment for all, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender characteristics, gender identity and expression, experience level, education, socio-economic status, nationality, appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.


## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contribute to a positive environment include:

 * Using welcoming and inclusive language
 * Respecting diverse perspectives and experiences
 * Accepting constructive criticism with gratitude
 * Focusing on what is best for the community
 * Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

 *   Using sexualized language or imagery and unwanted sexual attention or advances
 *   Trolling, abusive/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
 *   Public or private harassment
 *   Posting personal information of others, such as physical or email addresses,       without explicit permission
 *   Any other behavior that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project supporters are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project supporters have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct, or to temporarily or permanently ban any participant for behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project email address, posting through an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at online or offline events. Representation of the project may be further defined and clarified by the project supporters.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior can be reported by contacting the project team at conduct@xyzblockchain.com. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated, leading to a response deemed necessary and appropriate for the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality regarding the reported incident. Additional details regarding specific enforcement policies may be published separately.

Project supporters who do not adhere to or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent consequences as determined by other members of the project leadership.
