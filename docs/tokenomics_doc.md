# Proof Blockchain: Tokenomics

## Overview

Proof Blockchain utilizes a carefully designed tokenomic model to ensure network security, incentivize participation, and maintain long-term sustainability. This document outlines the key aspects of our token economy.

## PROOF Token

### Basic Information

- Name: Proof Token
- Symbol: PROOF
- Total Supply: 35,035,035 PROOF

## Token Distribution

### Initial Block Reward

- Starting block reward 10 blocks: 2000 PROOF
- Block time: 10 minutes (600 seconds)

### Reward Halving

- The block reward halves every 8,760 hours (approximately one year)
- Halving schedule continues until the total supply is reached

### Reward Allocation

For each block:
- 40% - Reward for the most active participant in the network
- 40% - Reward for the most active validator
- 10% - Locked in network liquidity
- 10% - Allocated to the development fund

## Transaction and Contract Fees

- Standard transaction fee: 0.05 cents
- Smart contract creation fee: 0.05 cents (equivalent to a standard transaction)

These low fees are designed to encourage frequent use of the network while maintaining economic sustainability.

## Staking and Validation

- Validators must stake PROOF tokens to participate in consensus
- Staking rewards are distributed from the validator portion of block rewards
- The amount of stake influences the chances of being selected to validate a block

## Liquidity Incentives

- 10% of block rewards are locked in liquidity pools
- Additional incentives for liquidity providers in decentralized exchanges

## Token Burning Mechanism

- 10% of all transaction and contract fees are burned
- This deflationary mechanism helps maintain the token's value over time

## Governance

- PROOF token holders can participate in governance decisions
- Voting power is proportional to the amount of PROOF held or staked
- Proposals for changes to the protocol, including tokenomics, require community voting

## Activity Selection System

The reward for the most active participant is determined by a comprehensive scoring system:

1. Transaction volume
2. Smart contract creation and interaction
3. Participation in governance
4. Contribution to network liquidity
5. Overall time active on the network

## Token Utility

PROOF tokens have multiple uses within the ecosystem:
1. Payment of transaction and smart contract fees
2. Staking for network validation
3. Governance participation
4. Collateral for certain DeFi applications built on Proof

## Long-term Sustainability

- The gradual reduction in block rewards through halving events ensures a decreasing inflation rate over time
- The burning mechanism provides a deflationary pressure to balance new token issuance
- Regular economic analyses and community-driven adjustments ensure the long-term viability of the tokenomic model

## Development Fund Usage

The 10% allocation to the development fund is used for:
1. Ongoing protocol development
2. Security audits
3. Ecosystem grants
4. Marketing and adoption initiatives

## Conclusion

The tokenomics of Proof Blockchain is designed to create a balanced, sustainable ecosystem that rewards active participation, ensures network security, and provides long-term value for all stakeholders. The low transaction and contract fees, combined with the deflationary mechanisms and clear incentive structures, aim to drive adoption and usage of the Proof network for a wide range of applications, from simple transactions to complex smart contracts.
