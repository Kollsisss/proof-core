### AIPL (AI Prompt Language) - Description

**AIPL**, or **AI Prompt Language**, is a new programming method that leverages AI to automate the creation of project code and structure. The idea is simple: instead of manually writing the code, you create a special AIPL file that contains all the necessary instructions for AI to generate a complete software project.  
*Explanation: AIPL is a framework designed to streamline software development by allowing users to specify project details in a structured format, which AI then uses to produce the code automatically.*

### Key Features of AIPL:

1. **File Structure:**  
   The AIPL file defines all the files and their locations within the project. For example, you can specify in which directory specific modules, like “src/tools/block_explorer/mod.rs,” should be located.  
   *Explanation: This feature allows users to outline how their project should be organized, making it easier to maintain and navigate.*

2. **Classes and Functions:**  
   You can define structures, implementations, and functions directly in the AIPL file. The AI will automatically generate the code according to these instructions.  
   *Explanation: By specifying classes and functions in the AIPL file, users can guide the AI in generating relevant code, reducing manual coding effort.*

3. **Dependencies:**  
   AIPL allows you to define the modules and libraries the project uses, so the AI understands which dependencies to include.  
   *Explanation: This ensures that the AI knows what external libraries or modules are needed for the project to function correctly.*

4. **Documentation:**  
   AIPL includes documentation for each part of the project, making it easy to understand the functionality and purpose of the generated code.  
   *Explanation: Providing documentation within the AIPL framework helps clarify the intended use and function of the generated code, aiding both developers and users.*

5. **Flexibility:**  
   AIPL is not tied to a single programming language. You can use it for different technologies (e.g., Rust, Python, JavaScript) by adjusting the syntax of the instructions.  
   *Explanation: This adaptability allows AIPL to be used across various programming environments, making it versatile for developers with different language preferences.*

### Example:
```plaintext
LANG: rust
```
*Explanation: This line indicates the programming language being used, which is Rust in this case.*

```plaintext
FINDEX: 2
FILE: src/lib.rs
```
*Explanation: `FINDEX` designates the file index number, while `FILE` specifies the path of the main library file in the project.*

```plaintext
MOD: core
MOD: layer1
MOD: layer2
MOD: layer3
MOD: crypto
MOD: wallet
MOD: api
MOD: tools
```
*Explanation: These lines define various modules that will be part of the project, organizing functionality into separate logical units.*

```plaintext
PUB_USE: core::blockchain::Blockchain
PUB_USE: layer1::zz_protocol::ZZProtocol
PUB_USE: layer2::xx_protocol::XXProtocol
PUB_USE: layer2::yy_protocol::YYProtocol
PUB_USE: layer3::zk_rollups::ZKRollup
PUB_USE: wallet::trust_integration::TrustWalletIntegration
```
*Explanation: The `PUB_USE` lines indicate the public modules and functions that will be used from different parts of the project, establishing dependencies and import paths.*

```plaintext

DOC:""" XYZ Blockchain is a revolutionary blockchain platform offering advanced features
and solutions for the modern decentralized ecosystem.
...
"""
```
*Explanation: This section contains documentation for the project, explaining its purpose, functionality, and key features to developers and users.*

```plaintext
STRUCTURE:
[] : FINDEX
{} : CURRENT FILE
```
*Explanation: This defines the structure of the project, with brackets indicating the index of files and the current file being processed.*

*Explanation: This block illustrates the project's directory structure, showing the hierarchy of files and modules within the `xyz-blockchain` project.*

**FILE LIST:**
```
1. Cargo.toml
2. {src/lib.rs}
3. src/config.rs
4. src/core/mod.rs
5. src/core/blockchain.rs
6. src/core/state.rs
7. src/core/database.rs
8. src/core/transaction.rs
```
*Explanation: This list provides a simple reference to the files included in the project, numbered for easy identification.*

**Overall Purpose of AIPL:**  
The main idea is to save time and effort by reducing the need for manually writing code. The AI generates most of the project structure and basic functionality by using AIPL files with well-defined instructions.  
*Explanation: AIPL aims to enhance productivity in software development by allowing developers to specify project details in an organized manner, enabling AI to handle the repetitive and time-consuming aspects of coding.*

**How to Get Started:**

1. **Create AIPL files, indexing them by the order of creation.**
2. **Create the complete project structure by also writing the file indexes.**
3. **Set the 0-20 Golden Rules as guidelines for your AI.**
4. **Upload the file and write "file gen" to generate the ready code from your AIPL file.**

### !For the best results, have another AI evaluate the code and provide improvements until the code becomes perfect.
